Project to create forum with NextJS, current tech stacks that I used are :

## Database & Back-End

I just awfully get used to Drizzle so once again I'm using Drizzle here. It's been a long time for me that I've been aiming to use Supabase and finally this is my first major project using supabase.

### Drizzle-ORM

I've never tried Prisma but Drizzle just so addictive, it's like Coke but I'll try Prisma sooner or later anyway.

### Supabase

I've been begging to my ADHD brain to try Supabase and Finally I got the chance. The first impression is it's great and sucks at the same time.

## UI & Front-End
